## Cell Theory

## Eukaryotic Cells
- Lysosomes
	- Contain enzymes that can lyse
	- Induce apoptosis if breakdown occurs

- ER
	- Rough ER - Where ribosomes attach
	- Smooth ER - Lipid synthesis and detox

- Golgi
	- Transport and modify things

- Peroxisomes
	- Participate in beta oxidation
	- Participate in the syntehsis of phospholipids


#### Cytoskeleton
- Microfilaments
	- Rods of actin
	- Participate in cleavage furrow

- Microtubules
	- Hollow polymers of tubulin proteins
	- Pathways along which kin and dy walk

	- Flagella
		- Eukaryotic flagellla
			- 9+2 structure
		- Prokaryotic flagella
			- twirly shit
	
	- Centrosome
		- Made up of centrioles
		- Made of microtubules
		- Emanate microtubules that connect to chromsomes at kinetochores
	
	
	- Kinetochores
		- wehre the things connect at
- Intermediate filmanents
	- Able to withstand lots of tension
	- 
## Classification and Structure of Prokaryotes
### Arcahea
- Extremophiles
- Energy from inorganic compounds


### Bacteria
- Bacilli
- Spirlli
- Cocci


### Aerobes and Anaerobes
- Facultative aerobes
	- Can do both anaerobic and aerobic things

- Aerotolerant anaerobes
	- Can't use oxygen but aren't harmed by its presence


### Cell walls
- Gram positive - Purple
	- Contains a 
- Gram negative - Pink
- 

## Genetics and Growth of Prokaryotic Cells
- Plasmids are extragenomic

- Types of prokaryotic genome transfer
	- Transformation - PIck up from the environment
	- Conjugation
		- Unidirectional from male to female
		- Sex factors are plasmids that contain the necessary genes
		- Ecoli that have sex factors are called F+. During conjugation, sex pilus takes from the F+ and gives to F-, converting it to an F+ cell. 
		- Very fast method of recombination
		- Entire genome replicates
	- Transduction
		- Using a virus that will infect the cell, and will reuptake some of the bacterial genome when it lyses and transfer that to another bacteria


## Viruses

- Types of bacteria
	- Bacteriophages
		- Tail sheath and tail fibers that recognize bacteria

		- Don't enter them


- Single strand RNA viruses
	- Positive sense rna virus
		- The RNA can be directly translated to proteins

	- Negative sense
		- The RNA has to have a complementary strand before being translated to proteins


- Retroviruses
	- Single stranded RNA viruses that convert their RNA into DNA, that is then integrated into the host genome.


#### Lifecycle
- Infection
- Translation
- Progeny Release


- What is the lytic cycle?
	- When the virus kills the host and lyses it to release new progeny

- What is lysogenic cycle
	- The virus puts its dna as part of the host dna and replicates that way


Prions
- infectious proteins

Viroids
- Infectious
