## Muscular System
- What are the functions of the muscular system?
	- Move around
	- involuntary movement
	- Keep heart pumping

- What does skeletal muscle look like?
	- Striated / Striped due to sarcomeres
	- Multinucleated

- What does skeletal muscle contain
	- Red - Slow twitch, lots of myglobin
	- White - Fast twitch, less myoglobin
	- Muscles that move slowly but sustain activity, red
	- Muscles that move fast but fatigue quickly, lots of white

- Smooth muscle
	- Seen all over the body
	- Mononucleated
	- Contain actin and myosin
	- Capable of more sustained contractions then skeletal muscle

- What is tonus?
	- Low level state of persistent contraction in smooth muscle

- What is myogenic activity?
	- Smooth muscle can interact without any nervous system input.

- Cardiac muscle
	- could have 1 or 2 nuclei
	- involuntary contraction
	- cardiac muscle cells are connected by intercalated disks, containing gap junctions that allow for flow of ions between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells
	  
	- Path of activity
		- SA Node -> AV Node -> Bundle of His -> Purkinje Fibers

	- Nervous and endocrine control of heart how? [[Chapter 4 - Nervous System]]
		- Vagus nerve provides parasympathetic outflow to the heart and slows heart rate

		- Norepi from sympathetic neurons and epi from adrenal medulla bind to adrenergic receptors in heart and cause increased heart rate. How happens is by increasing intracellular calcium levels.

- How do cardiac muscle cells communicate with each other so fast?
	- They have intercalated disks that contain gap junctions that join the cytoplasm of different cells

- What is the sarcomere?
	- Basic contractile unit of the skeletal muscle

- What is the structure of the sarcomere?
	- ![[Pasted image 20250508113928.png]]

- What are the gross structure of myocytes
	- 

- Categorize muscles as skeletal, smooth, or cardiac based on their innervation and structure
- Order the series of events in muscular contraction
	- Initiation
		- Efferent neurons transmit signal to nerve terminal at NT junction and releases acetylcholine to the synapse,
		- Depolarization of the myocyte sarcolemma, transmit signal down to the sarcoplasmic reticulum that will release Ca2+
		- Ca2+ binds to troponin, triggering change in conformation of tropomyosin, exposing myosin binding sites on thin filament
	- Sarcomere shortens
		- Myosin head on thick filament has ADP and Pi and it binds to exposed site on thin filament
		- ADP and Pi on myosin go away and this causes thick to pull on thin
		- ATP binds to myosin, causing it to not bind to the 
	- Relaxation
		- Neuron releases acetylcholinesterase to breakdown acetylcholine
		- When signal decays, Ca2+ does not bind to the troponin and myosin binding spots are gone, and thin filament lengthens again
		  

		  
- Does the myosin head have ADP on it when it's not working?
	- Yes. 

- What does it mean that muscle cells exhibit an all or nothing response?
	- You cannot modulate the amount of strength that a muscle cell outputs, only whether it does output or not.

- When is the max control achieved?
	- When all the fibers are stimulated to contract at the same time.

- What is a simple twitch?
	- Response of a single muscle fiber to a brief stimulus at or above threshold

- What is the latent period?
	- The time between reaching threshold and the onset of contraction.
	- At this point the action potential spreads along the muscle and ca is bieng released from SER

- What is frequency summation?
	- When contractions from stimuli that take place in sequence combine to form a larger contraction.

- What happens to oxyhemoglobin curve when there is increased carbon dioxide?
	- Undergoes a right shift so that hemoglobin has less affinity for oxygen then myoglobin, increasing efficiency of the system

- What happens if the red muscle cannot have enough oxygen?
	- Switches to anerobic respiration, producing lactic acid.

- What happens as aresult of oxygen debt?
