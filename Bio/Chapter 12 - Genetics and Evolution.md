## Fundamental Concepts of Genetics
- What is the difference between a dominant and recessive allele?
- Differentiate between homozygous, heterozygous, and hemizygous genotypes
- Compare and contrast complete dominance, codominance, and incomplete dominance
- **What is penetrance?**
- **What is expressivity?**
- What are Mendel's laws?
- What phase of meiosis are mendel's laws associated with?
- Connect Mendel’s laws with the phase of meiosis to which they are most closely correlated
## Changes in the Gene Pool
- What is a point mutation?
- Identify the three main types of point mutations and the genetic changes they are associated with
- Recall the two main types of frameshift mutation
- **What is genetic leakage?**
- **What are inborn errors of metabolism?**
- **What is an example of an inborn error metabolism?**
- Explain why genetic leakage would increase within the last century
- Describe the relationship between genetic drift, small population, and the founder effect
- Identify the main types of chromosomal mutation and the impact they have at the chromosomal level
## Analytical Approaches in Genetics
- Predict the phenotype ratio in the offspring of a cross, such as AaBB × AAbb
- Order genes on a chromosome given their recombination frequencies
- Recall the five criteria of the Hardy–Weinberg principle and the underlying population characteristic each one implies
- Solve calculation problems requiring use of the Hardy–Weinberg equations: _p_ + _q_ = 1, and _p^{2}+ 2pq + _q^2 = 1

## Evolution
- What are key tenets of punctuated equilibrium, 
- What are key tenets of natural selection
- What are key tenets of inclusive fitness
- **What are key features of the modern synthesis model**
- Identify the three patterns of selection and the changes they create in the population phenotype
- Recall the three patterns of evolution between species and the outcome of each
- What is the biological definition of a species?
- What is a prezygotic vs postzygotic isolation mechanism?
- What patterns of evolution are there?
- **What is the molecular clock model?**
