## Fundamental Concepts of Genetics
- Are genes on same or different places in different people?
	- Same gene will be on the same chromosome at the same place roughly

- What does it mean that some genes are hemizygous?
	- That there's only a single copy of it available. 

- Hemizygous vs homozygous vs hetero?
	- Homozygous there's 2 copies of the same gene
	- Hemizygous there's a single copy of the gene
	- Heterozygous there's single copies of different versions of the gene 

- Penetrance is what/
	- the percentage of people with a genotype to show the phenotype


- expressivity is what?
	- how people with same genotype show different pheno types
	  
- Penetrance is an idiveual param or a population param?
	- Popualtion param

- What is the difference between a dominant and recessive allele?
- Differentiate between homozygous, heterozygous, and hemizygous genotypes
- Compare and contrast complete dominance, codominance, and incomplete dominance
- **What is penetrance?**
- **What is expressivity?**
- What are Mendel's laws?
	- Segregation
	- Independant assortment


- What phase of meiosis are mendel's laws associated with?
	- Segregation - Anaphase I
	- Meiosis II

- Connect Mendel’s laws with the phase of meiosis to which they are most closely correlated


- DNA as genetic material experiments

- **Transforming experiment** - Non virulent bacteria made virulent by transforming from environment
		- injection of mice with pneumonia bacteria
		- virulent strain non virulent strain
		- when mice injected with nonvir, they were fine. 
		- when injected with vir, they died
		- when injected with vir and nonvir, they died and they found vir and nonvir bacteria in the mouth, so nonvir must've gotten from the vir 


- Avery,McCarty, McLeod
	- When bacteria were injected with stuff to degrade DNA, they didn't kill mice
	- When bacteria were injected with things to degrade protein, they still killed mice.

- Hershey
	- 2 groups of viruses. One with radiolabeled sulfur, other with radiolabeled phosphorous.
	- When they allowed to inject a bacteria, they found that the radiolabeled phosphorous was inside the bacteria but not the sulfur, so it must be that the DNA is the thing that genetic material is passed on

## Changes in the Gene Pool
- Transposons can remove and insert themselves in the middle of genes

- Nucleotide insertion vs chromosomal level insertion?
	- Nucleotide insertion is that you change the reading frame by adding a single base
	- Chromosome level insertion is when dna from one chromsome goes to another chromosome.
	- One gets larger, the other gets shorter

- What is chromsome level inversion?
	- Within the same chromsome, the sequence comes off and reinserts in the opposite way

- What is chromosome level translocation?
	- You swap entire sections of chromosomes



- What is a point mutation?
- Identify the three main types of point mutations and the genetic changes they are associated with
- Recall the two main types of frameshift mutation
- **What is genetic leakage?**
- **What are inborn errors of metabolism?**
	- Mutations that lead to deficiencies in genes needed for metabolism

- **What is an example of an inborn error metabolism?**
  
- Explain why genetic leakage would increase within the last century
	- 
- Describe the relationship between genetic drift, small population, and the founder effect
	- 
- Identify the main types of chromosomal mutation and the impact they have at the chromosomal level
## Analytical Approaches in Genetics
- Gene mapping
	- Crossing over happens during prophase 

- If 2 genes are far apart on the same chromosome, are they more likely to stay together or less likely during recombination?
	- Less likely to stay together

- What is the recombination frequency?
	- Roughly proportional to the distance between genes on the chromosome. 

- if you have 2 genes that are weakly linked, what recombination frequency do they have?
	- 50%

- 2 genes that are weakly linked, closer or farther from each other?
	- Far from each other on gene

- What unit is used to describe the distance between genes on a chromsome?
	- centimorgan

- the farther apart 2 genes are, are gametes more likely to recombine between them or less likely?
	- More likely


- If you have 2 tightly linked genes, do they have recombination frequency close to 0, or close to 50%?
	- close to 0, so they're very close

- What is the recombination frequency?
	- the likelihood that 2 alleles get separated from each other during crossing over

- Predict the phenotype ratio in the offspring of a cross, such as AaBB × AAbb
- Order genes on a chromosome given their recombination frequencies
- Recall the five criteria of the Hardy–Weinberg principle and the underlying population characteristic each one implies
- Solve calculation problems requiring use of the Hardy–Weinberg equations: _p_ + _q_ = 1, and _p^{2}+ 2pq + _q^2 = 1

## Evolution
- What are key tenets of punctuated equilibrium, 
- What are key tenets of natural selection
- What are key tenets of inclusive fitness
- **What are key features of the modern synthesis model**
- Identify the three patterns of selection and the changes they create in the population phenotype
- Recall the three patterns of evolution between species and the outcome of each
- What is the biological definition of a species?
- What is a prezygotic vs postzygotic isolation mechanism?
- What patterns of evolution are there?
- **What is the molecular clock model?**
	- The rate of evolution of a species indicates how much selective pressure is on it.
	- The more evolution, the more dynamic the environment, is morechanging.
	- degree of similarity between 2 species is based on how recently they split from a common ancestor. 
	- mice share 70% of dna with humans, but chimps share 95%, so chimps have a common ancestor that is closer in time.
