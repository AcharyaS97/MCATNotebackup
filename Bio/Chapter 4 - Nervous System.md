## Action Potentials
- Na is more outside the cell
- Leak channels of Na
	- Go inside the cell
- Leak channels of K
	- Go outside the cell

- Na/K pump
	- Against the concentration gradient
	- 3 Na shuttled outside
	- 2 K shuttled inside
	- Maintains the outside being more positive wrt to inside

- K is more inside the cell

- Absolute refractory
	- Because of Na channels being inactivated

## Organization
- Autonomic nervous system
	- Preganglionic nerve - CNS
	- Postganglionic nerve - PNS

- Motor neurons
	- Single neuron from CNS to the muscle
