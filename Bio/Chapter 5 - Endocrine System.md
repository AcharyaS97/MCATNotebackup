## Mechanisms of Hormone Action
### Hormone Classification
- Trophic vs direct
- Steroid
- Amino Acid
- Peptide
## Endocrine Organs and Hormones
### Hypothalamus
- GHRH
- GNRH
- CRF
- TRH
- 
### Pit
#### Post Pit
- Oxytocin
	- climax
	
- ADH
	- Water retention, anti peeing
#### Ant Pit - FLAT PEG
- F
- L
- A
- T
- P
- E
- G

### Thyroid
- Activated by TSH
- Secretes 
	- T3,T4 -> basal metabolic rate
	- Calcitonin -> downregulates blood Ca2+

- T3,T4 -> derived from tyrosine
- T3 -> triiiodothyrodine
### Parathyroid
- Secretes PTH
	- Downregulates blood calcium
### Adrenal Gland
- Ontop of the kidney (renal)

#### Cortex
- Salt - Mineralocorticoids

- Renin/Angiotensin/Aldosterone system - Upregulate the blood pressure
	- Renin secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells
	- Angiotensinogen -> Angiotensin I by Renin
	- Angiotensin I goes to the lungs and ACE converts into AII
	- AII increases heart rate
	- AII increases the vasoconstriction
	- AII travels to the Adrenal Cortex and makes it secrete Aldosterone
	- Aldosterone upregulates Na/K pump at collecting duct, makes it secrete water, blood volume increases, so stroke volume increases
	- BP = HR x SV x SVR

- Sugar - Glucocorticoids
	- Cortisol
		- Upregulates gluconeogenesis

- Derived from the mesoderm
#### Medulla
- Sex
	- Make androgens in males and females
	- Males benefit less because they make 

- Produces catecholamines
	- norepinephrine, epinephrine

- Norepi/Epi metabolic rates
	- increase Glycogenolysis
	- increase bmr
	- 
- Derived from the ectoderm

#### Pancreas
- alpha cells - glucagon - Increase blood glucose by upregulating gluconeogenesis, glycogen phosphorylase
- b cells - insulin - reduce blood glucose and increase glycolysis by GLUT IV
- d-somatostatin - Stop everything


#### Testes
- Increase testosterone in response to LH
- Ovaries release estrogen in response to FSH

### Kidneys
- Release erythropoeitin
	- Makes rbcs
