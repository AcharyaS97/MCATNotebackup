## Anatomy and Mechanism of Breathing
### Anatomy
- What are the nares?
	- The nostrils

- What are the vibrissae?
	- Nasal hairs

- What is the path of air from outside into the lungs?
	- Nares -> Pharynx -> Larynx -> Trachea -> Bronchi -> Bronchioles -> Alveoli

- What is the purpose of surfactant on the alveoli?
	- To lower the surface tension and prevent them from collapsing in on themselves

- Which lung has 3 lobes and which lobe has 2?
	- The left lung has 2 lobes
	- Right Lobe has 3

- What does the thoracic cavity contain?
	- The heart and lungs

- What are the plueara?
	- Membranes that surround each lung

- What's the inner surface of the pluerae called?
	- Visceral pluraea

- What's the outer surface?
	- Pareital plaura

- What is the diaphragm?
	- Thin structure that divides the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity


### Breathing
- Is the diaphragm under somatic or autonomic control?
	- Somatic

- What is the intrapleural space?
	- In between the visceral and pareital plura
### Inhalation
- Is inhalation active or passive?
	- active

- What structures are involved in inhalation?
	- external intercostals
	- diaphragm expands
	  
- What happens to the intrathoracic volume during inhalation?
	- It increases

- What happens to intrapleural pressure during inhalation?
	- It decreases

- What happens when intrapleural pressure decreases?
	- The gas in the lungs is at a higher pressure then the intrapleural space.
	- The lungs will expand into the intrapleural space

- What is negative pressure breathing?
	- Driving force is the lower pressure in the intrapleural space compared with the lungs.
### Exhalation
- Is exhalation active or passive?
	- Passive

- What happens when the diaphragm and external intercostals relax?
	- Chest cavity decreases in volume, the pressure in the intrapleural cavity increases, to be larger. Air rushes out

- What are the role of the internal intercostals during exhalation, what effect this has?
	- They oppose the external intercostals and push the rib cage down, pulling down the thoracic cavity, decreases the volume

- What is the role of the surfactant on the alveoli?
	- Prevent collapse of the alveoli during exhalation

- When the chest wall relaxes, the lungs recoil

- The surface tension of the alveoli increases

- How are lung capacities measured?
	- During a spirometer. 
### Lung Capacities and Volume
- Total Lung Capacity
	- The total volume of air that the lungs can hold when fully expanded
- Residual volume
	- Volume left in the lungs after a full exhalation
- Vital capacity
	- Volume after full inhalation - Volume after full exhalation
- Tidal volume
	- Volume in the lungs during regular inhalation / exhalation
- Expiratory reserve
	- The amount of air that you can exhale after a normal exhalation
- Inspiratory reserve
	- After a full inhalation, how much more can you inhale

### Regulation Of Breathing
- Where ventliation controlled in the brain?
	- Medulla oblongata

- How is breathing regluated?
	- As partial pressure of CO2 increase, respiratory rate increases to offset it
- During hyperoxemia, what hapens?
	- inspiration rate falls to offset blood oxygen elvels

## Functions of the Respiratory System
### Gas Exchange
- Which major artery do capillaries get oxygenated blood from?
	- Pulmonary artery

- Do pulmonary veins send oxygenated or deoxygenated blood?
	- To the left atrium

- What happens when we go to higher altitudes?
	- We breath more rapidly. More rbc production. More vascularization.


- Why does oxygen go from the air into the lungs?
	- Because the blood has a lower partial pressure of O2 than the air in alveoli, so go down the [] gradient

### Thermoregulation
- How does the respiratory system engage in thermoregulation?
	- Heat is lost from the blood to the environment during vasodilation
	- Heat is gained during vasoconstriction

- Does vasoconstriction cause heat to be released faster or slower?
	- Slower. Less surface area for blood

### Immune Function [[Chapter 8 - Immune System]]
- What is the first line of defense in the respiratory system against pathogens?
	- Vibrissae - Hair cells that trap particulate matter

- What enzyme does the saliva contain?
	- Lysozyme, breaks down gram+ peptidoglycan cell walls

- What is the mucuocilliary escalator?
	- Cilia that propel mucuous that trap pathogens up the respiratory tract and down into the stomach to be killed

- What is the cause of pnuemonia?
	- Bacteria that damages epithelium of the lungs and paralyzes the cilia lining

- What form of immune cell do macrophages have?
	- Macrophages
	- Mast cells
### pH Control
- What is the bicarb buffer system?
	$$ CO_{2}(g) + H_{2}O \rightarrow H_{2}CO_{3} \rightarrow HCO_{3}^{-} + H^{+}$$

- When the pH is too low (acidosis), what direction the equil shifts?
		- To the left, to reduce pH
		- Breathing rate will increase to get more CO2

- When the pH is too low (alkalemia), then?
	- Shift to the left, produce more carbon dioxide
	- Slow more breathing so that there's more CO2 retianed.
	- body will increase the acidity, try to shift to the right

- When carbon dioxide ends up getting very high, what happens?
	- The equilibrium shifts right, decreasing pH of blood.

- How does your body respond?
	- Your body is going to start breathing more, to reduce the CO2 level in the bloodstream, you start hyperventilating.

- If you're in a place where there's not very much CO2 in the air, what happens then?
	- The equilibrium will shift to the left, and pH will start to come up as HCO3 is protonated.
	- Your body is going to reduce breathing rate so that it's not offsetting carbon dioxide as quickly. 

- Between the lungs and the (kidneys), which plays a more immediate role in maintaining blood ph?
	- The lungs
