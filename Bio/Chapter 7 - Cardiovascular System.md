## Anatomy of Cardiovascular
- What are the 2 different circulatory systems?
	- Systemic circulation
	- Pulmonary circulation

- What is the artery through which systemic circulation happens?
	- Aorta

- What happens when the ventricles pump?
	- They send blood to the lungs
	  
- What happens when the atria pump?
	- They send blood to the ventricle
	  
- Between the atria and the ventricles which are stronger muscles?
	- Ventricles are stronger than atria

- What are the valves between the right atrium and ventricle?
	- tricuspid / semilunar

- what are valves between the left atrium and ventricle/
	- bicuspid / mitral

- What is the aortic valve?
	-  left ventricle and aorta

- what are the semi lunar valves?
	- pulmonary valves
	- aortic valves



- Why must the left side of the heart be more musclar than the right side?
	- because it has to pump blood farther

- What 
### Electrical Conduction
- path of conduction?
	- sa node
	- av node
	- purkinje fibers
	- bundle of his

- What is the atrial kick?
	- The signal between the SA node and the AV node that forces a bit more blood from the atria into the ventricles

- Is ventricular filling passive or active?
	- Passive. Mostly will fill as ventricle expands.

- What is the intraventricular septum wall?
	- Travel down the bundle of His.

- Does the vagus nerve provide sympathetic or parasympathetic signals?
	- Parasympathetic - WIll slow down the heart [[Chapter 4 - Nervous System]]

### Contraction
- What is systole?
	- Ventricular contraction and closure of AV valves

- Diastole
	- Ventricular relaxation and closing of semilunar valves, and blood from the atria fills the ventricles

- How do the arteries maintain presssure during diastole?
	- Because they are elastic they are able to maintain high pressure during systole which is then released during diastole.

- If the large arteries weren't elastic, what would happen then?

## Physiology of Cardiovascular
### Blood Pressure
- What is blood pressure?
	- Pressure differential between the circulatory system to keep blood flowing.
	- Force per unit area applied to the wall of blood vessels

- What is sphygmomanometer?
	- Measure the gauge pressure of systemic circulation

- How is blood pressure calculated?
	- Systolic / Diastolic
	- Ventricular contraction / Ventricular relaxation

- As you from arteries to veins how does pressure change?
	- It decreases

- Where is the largest drop in blood pressure occurring?
	- Across arterioles.

- How do you apply ohm's law to fluids? [[Chapter 6 - Circuits]]
	- V = IR turns into P = Cardiac Output x Total Peripheral Resistance

- How does total peripheral resistance change with the type of blood vessel?
	- R = pL/A
	- As the cross sectional area gets larger, the resistance decreases. Capillaries have a lower TPR than veins and arterioles
	- As the length of the section increases, the resistance increases. The longer a blood vessel, the more resistance it offers

- How do arterioles modulate blood pressure?
	- They can expand and contract to modulate how much blood is going through the capillaries that follow

- Are the portal systems in series with each other or parallel?
	- In series with each other

- Are capillary beds apart from the portal systems in series or parallel?
	- In parallel

- If a capillary bed vasodilates what happens to Total Peripheral Resistance?
	- It decreases. 

- What are responses if the blood pressure is too low?
	- Increase the heart rate(P prop CO, CO prop HR)
	- try to increase stroke volume?
	- Vasoconstriction of capillaries so that TPR goes up

- What happens if the osmolarity ([[Chapter 5 - Endocrine System]]) of blood is too high?
	- The body is going to try to increase the amount of fluid in the blood by retaining water, releasing antidireuetic dhormone
	- Somethign about renin-angiotensin system
	  
- What happens if blood pressure is too high?
	- body will try to downregulate sympathetic system

- What is ANP?
	- Atrial natriuretic peptide

- Where is ANP released from?
	- The cells of the atrium, causes diuresis / excretion, along with the loss of salt
