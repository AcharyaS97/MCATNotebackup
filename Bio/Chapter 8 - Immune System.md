	- What is lysozyme?
		- Nonspecific bacterial enzyme secreted in tears and saliva
	- GI Tract
		- Stomach acid is part of innate immune system, low pH kills most bacteria.
		- GI bacteria that lack the characteristics to cause infection and outcompete foreign pathogens

	- Complement System
		- Proteins in the blood that act as nonspecific defense against bacteria
		- Classical pathway
			- Requires binding of an antibody to a pathogen
		- Alternate pathway 
			- Does not require binding of antibody

	- If a cell is infected with a virus, what happens?
		- They produce interferons

	- What do interferons do?

			- Digests the invader using enzymes
			- Presents pieces of the invader to other cells using MHC protein
			- MHC binds to pathogenic peptide, carries it cell surface, recognized by adaptive immune system.
			- Release cytokines that stimulate inflammation


- MHC
	- Class I
		- Expressed by all nucleated cells
		- Foreign body protein is loaded onto an MHC and secreted to be presented to cell surface
		- Endogenous pathway
	- Class II
		- Only displayed by professional antigen presenting cells like macrophages
		- Pick up pathogens from the environment, process them and present them on an MHC-II
		- Exogenous pathway

- What are professional antigen presenting cells?
	- Macrophages, dendritic cells, B-cells and activated epithelial cells

- How do macrophages recognize the type of invader they are presented?
	- They have pattern recognition receptors
	- Toll-like receptors

- What is a Natural Killer cell?
	- Nonspecific lymphocyte
	- Detects downregulation of MHC protein
	- induce apoptosis of viral cells
	- Cancer cells also downregulate MHC production so also offers protection from cancer tooj

- Granulocytes
	- Basophils
		- Large purple granules
	
	- Eosinophils

- Recall the major classes of lymphocytes and their functions
	- B cells
		- Produced in the bone marrow and mature in splen
		- Humoral response
	- T cells
		- Produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus

- What is humoral immunity?
	- Production of antibodies
	- Antibodies are specific to antigens of the microbe
	- Antibodies produced by B cells


- Describe the three main effects that circulating antibodies can have on a pathogen
	- Agglutination - Antibodies cause the pathogens to clump together
	- Opsonization - Antibodies mark pathogens to killed by other immune cells
	- Prevent pathogen from invading tissues

- Antibody effects on cell surface antibodies
	- Binding of antigen to a B cell causes activation of that cell, resutling in proliferation and formation of plasma and memory cells

	- When antigen binds to mast cell, causes degranulation (release granules and cause allergic reaction)

- What is antibody made of?
	- 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains

- What are light and heavy chains held together by?
	- Disulfide bridges

- What are the 2 parts of an antibody?
	- Antigen binding domain at the tips of the Y

- What is hypermutation?
	- Each B-cell undergoes hypermutation of antigen binding region to find a match

- What is clonal selection?
	- only cells that bind the antigen survive

- What are the isotypes of antibodies? Antibodies are **MADE**
	- IgM
	- IgA
	- IgD
	- IgE

- Are antibodies produced all the time?
	- No

- What is the primary response?
	- Initial activation of plasma cells producing large numbers of lymph nodes.
	- Takes 7-10 days

- What is the secondary response?
	- After primary response, the memory cells rapidly proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells to produce antibodies
	  
- Describe the effects of positive and negative selection on T-cell maturation
	- T cells undergo positive and negative selection
	- Positive selection
		- Only allow maturation of cells that can respond to antigen presented on MHC
	- Negative selection
		- Causing apoptosis in cells that are self reactive, bind too strongly

- What are the 3 types of T cells?
	- helper T cells
	- suppressor T cells
	- killer T cells

- What are helper T cells?
	- Th cells (CD4+)
	- Secrete lymphokines, that recruit other immune cells and increase their activity
	- Respond to antigens presented on MHC-II molecules
	  
- What happens in HIV?
	- helper T cells are lost and immune system cannot mount an adequate response to infection

- What are cytotoxic t cells?
	- CD8+ cells
	- Capable of killing virally infected cells by injecting chemicals that promote apoptosis
	- CD8+ t cells respond to antigens presented on MHC-I molecules

- Supressor T cells
	- Express CD4 but also differentiated from regulatory T cells
	- Express a protein Foxp3.
	- Help tone down an immune repsonse after infection was contained
	- Turn off self reactive lymphocytes to prevent autoimmune diseases

- What are memory T cells?
	- Lie in wait until the next exposure to the same antigen

- What are the 5 types of infectious pathogens?
	- Bacteria
	- Viruses
	- Fungi
	- Parasites
	- Prions

- How do you protect against a bacterial infection?
	- Macrophages engulf bacteria and release inflammatory markers
	- Macrophages present antigens on MHC II
	- Mast cells activated by inflammation, cause degranulation, leading to histamine release and increased leakiness of capillaries
	- Dendritic cells are leaves affected issues and travels to nearest lymph node, presents antigen to B-cells
	- B-cells go through clonal selection and the proliferate to create plasma and memory cells
	- Antibodies travel through bloodstream to affected issue where they tag the bacteria for destruction
	- Dendric cells present antigen to T-cells, activating T response, in particular CD4+ T cell.
	- Th1 cells release interferon gamma that activates macrophages and increases their ability to kill bacteria.

- Viral infection (Intracellular pathogen)
	- Virally infected cell produces interferons, reducing permeability of nearby cells, reducing rate of transcription and translation in these cells, causing systemic symptoms.
	- Infected cells show antigens on MHC-I
	- CD8+ T-cells recognize the MHC I antigen complex and inject toxins to promote apoptosis.
	- If virus downregulates MHC-I, then NK cells will inject toxins to induce apoptosis.

- Recognition of self and nonself
	- Self antigens are proteins and carbs present on surface of every cell of the body.
	- Autoimmunity - when the immune system fails to make a distinction between self and nonself

- What is a hypersensitivity reaction?
	- Immune system is hypersensitive to shit


- What is immunity?
	- Active immunity - Immune system is stimulated to produce antibodies against a specific pathogen.
	- Passive Immunity - Results from transfer of antibodies to an individual. Only the antibodies are transferred, not the plasma cells that produce them. Eg when mom sends antibodies to fetus
	  
- Explain why the secondary response to a pathogen is more efficient than the primary response

## The Lymphatic System
- Predict how a blockage of flow from a lymph node would impact the lymphatic system and the body as a whole
- Describe the factors and structures linking lymphatic and cardiovascular circulation

- What is the structure of the lymphatic system?
	- Made up of one way vessels that carry lymphatic fluid to form a large thoracic duct in the posterior chest, which delivers fluid into left subclavian vein
	- Lymph nodes
		- Small bean shaped structures along lymphatic vessels.
		- Contain a lymphatic arttery and a vein.
		- Provide a space for immune cells to be exposed to possible pathogens

- What is the function of the lymphatic system?
	- Equalization of fluid distribution
		- Fluid leaves the bloodstream nd goes into tissues. Fluid that leaves at the end of the capillary bed dpeends on hydrostatic and oncotic pressures. Oncotic pressures draws water back into the vessel at the venule end.
		- Lymphatic vessels drain tissues of fluid that remains at the end of the tissue.

	- What is edema?
		- Swelling due to fluid collecting in tissue.

	- Transportation of fats from digestive system into the bloodstream.
		- Lacteals at the center of each villus in small intestine are sent from chylomicrons into intestinal mucousal cells.
		- Chyle contains chylomicrons

	- Immunity
		- B-cells proliferate and mature in the lymph nodes
