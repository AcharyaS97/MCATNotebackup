## Thermo and Bioenergetics
- Describe the relationship between Δ_G_° and Δ_G_°′
- Explain why heat can be used as a measure of internal energy for biological systems
- Predict the spontaneity of a reaction given the signs of Δ_H_ and Δ_S_

## Role of ATP
- Predict the impact of ATP coupling on the energetics of a reaction
	- ATP provides the free energy to drive endergonic reactions
	- ATP is produced from the free energy released in exergonic reactions
- Calculate free energy change for an overall reaction given energetic data for component reactions
- Relate the structure of ATP to its role as an energy carrier
- How much gibbs free energy per mol when you phosphorylate ATP?
	- -55kj/mol
