## Enzymes as Catalysts
- Why are enzymes useful?
	- Because they aren't used by an rx and help it go faster temps that are conducive to life

- How do enzymes affect the activation energy?
	- Reduce it
- How do enzymes affect the rate?
	- Increase it
- How do enzymes affect the equilibrium onstnat?
	- Nochange
- How do enzymes affect the delta G?
	- Don't change it

- what is enzyme specificity?
	- enzymes only catalyze a certain class of reactions

- What are the classes of enzymes?
	- Lyases
		- Single thing into multiple products and don't need water
		- Also called a synthase when they catalyze reverse reation making single thing out of multiple things
	- Isomerases - Cause isomerization of bonds in a molecule
	- Ligases
		- Catalyze addition or synthesis reactions
		- Ususally need atp
	- Hydrolyase - Break things using water
	- Oxidoreductases - Cause a redox reaction
	- Transferases - Cause a transfer of one group to another
	
- How do enzymes affect activation energy?
	- They reduce the activation energy.

- Recognize how enzymes affect thermodynamics and kinetics of a reaction
	- Enzymes don't change the thermodynamics of a reaction but affect the kinetics of it.

## Mechanisms of Enzyme Activity
- Waht is the ES complex?
	- Enzyme and substrate interaction
- What is the active site?
	- Where the substrate binds.
- How is specificity created by the active site?
	- Only a specific enzyme in a given orientation will work
- What is a coenzyme?
	- Organic molecules, derivatives of NAD and FAD
- What is a cofactor?
	- Inorganic molecules that are attached to enzymes to get them to work (ie electron transport chain cofactors of Mg)

- What is a holoenzyme?
	- Enzymes with their cofactors

- What is an apoenzyme?
	- Enzyme without its cofactor
	  
- What is the induced fit model?
	- Enzyme and substrate when they are near each other induce conformational changes in each other to get each other to fit. 

- What is the lock and key model?
	- Active site is a lock and the substrate is the key.
	- No conformational change is necessary in the enzyme or substrate
## Enzyme Kinetics
- What is graph of reaction rate vs enzyme concentration?
	- Linearly with enzyme concentration
	  
- What is graph of reaction rate vs substrate concentration?
	- Will level out at some max rate when all the enzymes are used
- ![[Pasted image 20250506161011.png]]
	- What does vmax represent?
		- The max rate of the reaction when all the enzymes are being used.
	- What is the Km?
		- The amount of substrate to reach 1/2 vmax.
	- How to increase vmax?
		- By adding more enzyme
		  
	- If you were in a cell, how do you increase vmax?
		- By upregulating transcription and translation of the enzyme gene
		  
	- What is it called when the max velocity is reached?
		- Saturation

	- How do you change Km for a given enzyme?
		- You cannot

	- If Km is larger does that mean the enzyme has higher affinity or lower affinity?
		- Lower. Need more S to reach 1/2 vmax.

	- What is the MM equation?
		-  $$ 
		  
		  V = \frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_{m} + [S]}
		  
$$
	- What is the units of vmax?
		- mol E / s

	- What is kcat?
		- The number of substrate molecules converted to product per second

	- What is the equation for kcat?
		- $$ V_{max} = [E]*k_{cat} $$

	- Express mm in terms of kcat
		- $$ V = \frac{k_{cat}ES}{K_{m}+S} $$

	- When Km >> S what does that turn into?
		- $$ V = \frac{kcatES}{K_{m}} $$
	- What is the Lineweaver-Burke plot?
		- Take the S vs V curve and instead do 1/S vs 1/V


	- What is the LB equation?
		- 1/v = km/vm * s + 1/max

	- What is the x intercept of the LB plot?
		- -1/Km
		  
	- What is the y intercept of the LB plot?
		- 1/Vm
		  
- Predict how changes in enzyme and solute concentration will affect enzyme kinetics

- Define enzyme cooperativity
	- Enzymes that have multiple subunits that can exist in a low affinity tense state or a high affinity relaxed state. When the substrate comes near, a few of the subunits change to relaxed and this causes others to change to relaxed as well, this type of feedback. 
	
- What is the shape of a cooperative enzyme vs noncooperative enzyme?
	- Cooperative enzyme MM plot looks like a sigmoid instead of a hyperbola

- What is Hill's coefficient?
	- Quantification of the amount of cooperativity

- If Hill's coeff > 1, what does that mean?
	- Positive cooperativity. When one ligand binds to subunit, affinity of others increases

- If HIll's coeff < 1, what does that mean?
	- Negative cooperatviity. When one ligand binds, affinity decreases for others

- If hill's coeff = 1, what does that mean?
	- No cooperativity

- What is a Michaelis–Menten plot?
- Explain key points on a Lineweaver–Burk or Michaelis–Menten plot
	- X intercept is 1/vmax. 
	- Y intercept is -1/Km.



## Effects of Local Conditions on Enzyme Activity
- Predict how changes to the environment will alter enzyme behavior
- How does increase in temperature affect enzyme behavior?
	- Will add energy to enzyme, making things looser, giving more energy to molecules. Will increase enzyme activity until it causes denaturation.
- How does decrease in temperature affect enzyme behavior?
	- As temp decreases, molecules lose energy, so they become stiffer, less functional.
- How does pH affect enzyme activity?
	- pH will affect the protonation state of various residues. At higher pH things will deprotonate.
	- At lower pH, residues will protonate
- How does salinity affect enzyme activity?
	- Can change the enzyme activity in the cell because of disrpution to hydrogen or ionic bonding
- Estimate the ideal pH and temperature for enzymes found in the human body

## Regulation of Enzyme Activity
- What is feedback inhibition?
	- Enzymes are downregulated by products of the pathways that they are involved in.
	- A -> B -> C -> D
	- D downregulates A
	- Product will bind to active site and prevent creation of it
	  
- What is feedforward regulation? Example?
	- What is feedforward regulation?

- What are the 4 types of reversible inhibtion?
	- Competitive inhibition
		- Inhibitor competes with the substrate for access to the enzyme at the active site
		- Km goes down because you need more substrate to reach the same Vmax. Rate of enzyme working not changed.

	- 


- What is irreversible inhibition?
	- When something binds to the enzyme and prevents it from working.
	  
- What is a transient enzyme modification?
- What is a covalent enzyme modification?
- What is a zymogen?
	- An enzyme that secreted in an inactive form
	- Contain a catalytic and a regulatory domain. Regulatory domain must be removed or altered to expose the active site.
	- Have the suffix -ogen
	- Caspases exhibit similar regulation
	  
- What are traits of zymogens?
	- Secreted as catalytically inactive because they can harm the organism itself.
	- Contain a regulatory domain and a catalytic domain.

- How do you make a zymogen active?
	- Remove or modify the regulatory domain
