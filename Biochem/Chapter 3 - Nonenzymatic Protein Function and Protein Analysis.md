- 3 main groups
	- Ungated
	- Voltage gated
	- Ligand gated

- What are enzyme linked receptors?
		- 3 main domaisn:
			- membrane doman - anchros the receptor in the cell membrane
			- ligand bidnging domain - Stimulated by the appropriate ligand and causes conformaiton change i the catalytic domain
			- catalytic domain - WHen confomrational change, this will induce a secondary messenger cascade.

	- CLosed at rest and then open when depolarization of the membrane
	- FOund in the SA node of the heart

## GPCRs
- What are they?
	- Integral proteins
- What are tehy characterised by?
	- 7 membrane spanning a helixes
	  
	
- There are 3 main kinds of G proteins
	- Gs -> Stimulats adenylate cyclase => INcreases cAMP
	- Gi -> Inhibits adenylate cyclase -> Decreases cAMP
	- Gq -> Activates phospholipase C, which cleaves phospholipid from membrane to form PIP2, which is cleaved into DAG and IP3. IP3 can open calcium channels in ER and increase intracellular calcium
	  
- There are three subunits to G proteins
	- alpha, beta, gamma

- When inactive a, what does it do?
	- bind GDP and complex with B and gamma

- When a ligand binds to GPCR whath apens?
	- receptor is acivated, G protein is engaged.
	- GDP replaced with GTP and a subunit goes away
	- a subunit alters the activty of adenlyl cyclase

- If a subunit detaching is ai, 
	- then there is inhibiton of the enzyme that the ligand attached to on extracellular surface
- if a subunit detacthing is as, then extracellular ligand is activated

- What are ligand gated channels?
- What are enzyme linked receptors?

- After GTP is dephosphorylated, what happens?
	- Rebind to the b and y subunits, rendering it in actie

## Protein Isolation
- Before isolation can be done, what other techniques are there toget things isolated?
	- Lysis techinques and homogenization - Crush and blend the tissue
	- What is centrifugation?
		- Done before others


- What is the formula for migration velocity in a gel?
		$$ v = \frac{Ez}{f}$$
	- v = migration velocity
	- E = electric field strength
	- f = frictional coefficient => dpends on mas and shape
	- z = net charge on the molecules


- What is Polyacrylamide gel?
	- Standard gel. Solid at room temp

## Native PAGE
- Analyze proteisn in their native states
- Limtations => Multiple proteins might migrate the same because they have the same mass mass / charge ratio and mass / size ratio
- Samples only retrieved if the gel hasn't been stained.

## SDS PAage
- Sodium dodecyl sulfate
- Apply a detergent so that all the proteins have the same negative charge. 
- Put them into gel afterwards.
- As proteins move through the gel, only the electric field and the mass plays a role. their net charge all the same.
- Requires denaturing the protnein

## Isoelectric Focusing
- What is it?
	- SEapration of proteins based on the isoelectric point [[Chapter 1 - Amino Acids#Acid Base Titration]]
	- pI is when the species can act like a zwitterion, having negative and positve charge

	- For acids with neutral side chains, when is pI?
		- When amino group is protonated and carboxyl is deprotonated

	- For AA with lysine and arginine side chains, when is pI?
		- When amino is deprotonated
		- When nitrogenous base is protonated
		- Carboxyl is deprotonated

	- Whatis the setup in isoelectric focusing?
		- mixture of gels in a pH gradient. Electric field is generated across the gel. Proteins that are positively charged begin migrating towards cathode
		- negatively charged proteins migrate toward anode

	- How does gel pH change closer to the anode?
		- Acids ahve protons. Protons are positvely cahrged. The Anode is positvely charged, so the pH is lower

	- HOw does ph change closer to the cathode?
		- ph is higher

## Chromatography
- What is the basis of chromatography?
	- Separating out stuff based on their relative sizes and other shit

- What is column chromatography?
	- SIlica beads in a column. Solvent at the top, some sand. Compounds in the solvent will have different amounts of affinity for the beads and the sand so whatever you collect in the beaker the fastest will be nonpolar, least unlike the properties of things in the column

- What is ion exchange chromatography?
	- Beads in the column are charged so that when the elute flows through it, oppositely cahrged particles in it will be attracted to the beads and stay stuck on them

- How do you recharge the beads?
	- Wash them in salt so that they go back to being charged

- What is size exclusion chromatography?
	- Beads contain pores of varying sizes. Pores allow small compounds to enter the beads, slowing them down
	- The bigger compounds have a much slower retention then the smaller compounds.

- Affinity Chromatography?
	- Columns that contain beads that bind to any protein you want.
	- Coat beads in a receptor that binds the protein or antibody for that protein

- What are common stationary phase molecules?
	- Nickel, used in separation of genetically engineered proteins w hisitidine tags
	- antibodies, antigens

- How is the protein eluted from the column??
	- Washed wtih a free receptor that will compete with the receptors on the beads and free the proteins stuck on there.

- What is Edman degradation?
	- Used to determine the amino acid composition of a protein

- What is the process of Edman degradation?
	- Used to cleave amino acids from the N- terminus for polypeptides upto 70 long

- How do you sequence larger proteins?
	- Use reagents like chymotrypsin, trypsin or cyanogen bromide to cleave the protein at speicifc points, and then do edman degradation or electrophoersis on that 


- How are the activity of different proteins measured?
	- Monitor a reaction of the protein to another that's a standard. Activity is correlated with concentration


- How is concentration of a sample determined?
	- Using a UV spec

- What's a downside of using a UV spec to determine concentration?
	- It's very sensitive to contaminants


- WHat is the bradford proetin assay?
	- Mix protein in solution with blue dye. Dye is protonated and green/brown befroe mixing. Dye deprotonates and turns blue. Ionic interactions b/w dye and the protein make it turn blue. Samples of known protein concentration are reacted with the bradford reagent and the absorbance is measured to create a curve.
	- Unknown sample is put under same conditions and the absorbance is measured.

- Is the bradford assay more or less accurate with a single protein in the mix?
	- More accurate.
