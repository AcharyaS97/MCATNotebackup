## TODO
- Draw the structures of glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose in fischer

- Aldol vs aldose?
	- Aldol is aldehyde + alcohol
	- Aldose is aldehyde and every other carbon has 1 H and one OH
	  
- What's an aldose? [[Aldehydes#Aldehydes II#Aldol Condensaiton]]
	- Sugar with aldehyde and alcohol

- What is the simplest ketose sugar?
	- DHAP

- What is a glycosidic linkage?

- What is the identifying thing about a monosacharride?
	- Every single carbon except for carbonyl carbon has atleast 1 OH group

- Draw D-glucose
- Draw D-fructose
- Draw D-galactose
- Draw D-mannose

- What is D/L?
	- D and L are enantiomers

- How determine D/L?
	- Look at the fischer projection
	- If ketone then count to make carbonyl smallest
	- If the hydroxide on the highest numbered chiral carbon is on the right, that's D (dextero)
	- If hydroxide is on the left, that's L

- What's an epimer?
	- Diastereomer but it's only 1 thing that's changed
	- (R,R,S,R,S) vs (R,R,S,R,R)

- What's B-anomer vs a-anomer of hexose?
	- a-hexose has an axial OH

 - how form cyclic hemiacetal?
	 - OH on aldose nucleophilic addition across carbonyl carbon on same molecule

- would fructose form a hemiacetal or hemiketal?
	- hemiketal

- What is the anomeric carbon?
	- The carbonyl carbon

## Reactions of Monosacharrides
### Redox
- What happens when you oxidize a straight chain aldose?
	- You get get an aldonic acid

- What is an ester?
	- carbonyl with o bonded to something else
	- O=C-OR
	  
- What happens when you oxidize a ring aldose?
	- Cyclic ester

- What is a reducing sugar? Why?
	- Straight chain aldoses and ketoses, because they can cause reduction

- How do you detect the presence of a reducing sugar?
	- You try to reduce something w it, and hope that the oxidized vs reduced forms are different enough to see visually

- What is Tollen's Reagent?
	- AgNO3 mixed with NaOH to form Ag2O
	- Ag2O mixed in NH3 to form (Ag(NH3)2)+

- What happens to tollens when you have aldehydes?
	- Produces a silvery mirror

 - What is Benedict's reagent?
	 - When it gets reduced, it forms red Cu preciptated

- What happens when you oxidize an alcohol all the way?
	- you turn alcohol -> carbonyl -> carboxylic acid

- What happens when you oxidize an cyclic aldose?
	- All the OH's turn into esters

- What is a glycosidic linkage?
	- When a hemiacetal / hemiketal bonds with an alcohol to form an acetal / ketal.
	- The linkage is between the carbohydrate on the one side and the carbohydrate on the other

- What is a glycoside?
	- A linkage between 2 carbohydrates

- What is a furanoside?
	- 2 furanose rings connected by glycosidic linkage

- What is a pyranoside?
	- 2 pyranose rings connected by glycosidic linkage

 - In an alpha linkage, are they trans or cis to each other?
	 - Trans to each other

- What is cellulose?
	- D-Glucose in a b-1,4 linkage

- Starch?
	- Glucose in a-1,4 linkage
- Amylopectin?
	- Glucose in a-1,6

- What's the diff between alpha amylase and beta amylase?
	- alpha cleaves at nonreducing end
	- beta cleaves randomly
