## Glucose Transport
- When glucose is high, go where?
	- To the liver
- When low, go where?
	- Elsewhere
- What are the sensors of glucose amount?
	- Glucokinase, b-islet, glut 2 transporter

- List the locations and functions of the GLUT 2 and GLUT 4 glucose transport proteins
- What is GLUT 2? 
	- On regular cells
- Where is GLUT 2 found?
- What is GLUT 4 and where found?
	- On adipose
- Diff b/w glut 2 and glut 4
	- 2 has higher Km, so take more to saturate it
	- 4 has lower km
- **glut 2 can take in more glucose than glut4 ecause it' has a higher km?**

- Predict how increased blood glucose levels will impact GLUT 2 and GLUT 4 activity

### NADH Shuttles
- Cytosolic NADH can't make it into the inner matrix so it needs to pass along via other things
#### Malate-Aspartate Shuttle
- OAA is reduced to malate taking electrons from NADH in cytosol
- Malate goes into inner matrix
- Malate is oxidized to OAA, gives electrons away, and then OAA is back into Aspartate and comes out
