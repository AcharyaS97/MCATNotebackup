| 5/29/25   | 3/6 9 mi Milton and Bentley<br>1 - Question about main idea of passage, got wrong because I didn't understand<br><br>2- Unsure about how to solve qeustion, so i guessed. This was about reasoning beyond the text<br><br>6 - Main idea question. I was on the right track for where I looked, but I went too far. Question was asking about what the author thought the book's main point was, and I deferred to the section in last paragraph where the author talked about that, but then went beyond it<br><br>![[Pasted image 20250529103745.png]] then  ion.  >3 -                                              |                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5/29      | 3/7 - Rear window - 9 minutes<br><br>1 - Correct because read that everything is from his perspective<br><br>2 - Wrong because question asking about the significance of "color" to the MAIN idea. last paragraph says that visual is better than auido but that' swrong.<br><br>3 - Felt rushed. Entirely needed to use info from the paragraph where the idea was discussed. Had to take the first sentence of paragraph and translate it to what the question was asking.<br><br>6 - Had to pick which thing aligned with main idea.<br><br>Mutiny of 1857 4/5 on 9 minuts<br>4 - didn't udnerstand the main idea. |                                                                                                                                                                            |
