![[Pasted image 20250628124312.png]]


- 
- Needed to recognize that the a/E ratio i could use as the slope from the graph![[Pasted image 20250628130726.png]]

- Would've saved time if i knew that g/dm^3 is the same as kg/m^3
![[Pasted image 20250628134005.png]]


- How long should i be spending on questions like this? I ran into trouble trying to balance the shit and then ended up guessing
![[Pasted image 20250628134524.png]]


- Dumb mistake
![[Pasted image 20250628145600.png]]

- If i have same units (mg / mL) then I can simplify that to g/L

- This was a passage question
![[Pasted image 20250628150716.png]]

#### Test Taking
- Recognition of concepts
![[Pasted image 20250705101844.png]]


- Missed the fact that the enzyme was a protease, so it cleaves peptide bonds
![[Pasted image 20250705104714.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250705111141.png]]


- Read the passage
![[Pasted image 20250705111309.png]]

- I need to read the passage
![[Pasted image 20250705112047.png]]

- The ecel they gave was not for the reaction in the qeustion. Had to use passage understanding. 
![[Pasted image 20250705113545.png]]

- **Recognition of how to sovle this**
![[Pasted image 20250705113956.png]]



(Recognition)
- Recognized where in the passage I had to read from but then I was lost about the fact that I had to pull out the fact that it was phosphorylation, so it had to be kinase
![[Pasted image 20250705115729.png]]

(Recognition of the fact that they were looking for things with metal cations and so i had to pick the one with negative, charged, side chains)
