# Aldehydes I
- How do you distinguish aldehydes and ketones?
	- They have strong smells
## Nomenclature
- What suffix do you use when an aldehyde is in a ring?
	- -carbaldehyde

- how you name ketones as a parent chain?
	- give thhe numbering that makes the carboxyl the smallest and add -one

- how do you name ketones as substituents?
	- use oxo or keto prefix

- what's the difference between cyclopentanone and cyclopentanal?
	- cyclopentanone -> carboxyl on one of them
	- cyclopentanal -> methyl with a carboxyl on it that's attached to the main chain


## Physical Properties
- How does the boiling and melting point of a ketone compare to an alcohol?
	- Lower boiling point and higher melting point because alcohols can hydrogen bond but ketones/aldehydes cannot

- Between alcohol and ketone/aldehyde, which has the more polar dipole?
	- The aldehyde has a stronger dipole because the pi bond makes it more electron dense

- Is the carbonyl oxygen electron withdrawing or electron donating?
	- Electron withdrawing

- Do aldehydes and ketones act as electrophiles or nucleophiles?
	- They act as electrophiles because the carbonyl oxygen puts a positive charge on the carbon

- Between aldehydes and ketones which are the better electrophiles?
	- Aldehydes because there is less steric hinderance, less alkyl groups so less electron donating groups. 

## Formation
- How do you make an aldehyde from a primary alcohol?
	- Add PCC and oxidize it

- How do you make a ketone from a secondary alcohol?
	- Add PCC and oxidize

- Generally how do you make aldehyde/ketone from alcohol?
	- oxidize an alcohol

## Nucleophilic Addition
- What is the general mechanism of nucleophilic addition across a carbonyl?
	- The nucleophile attacks the carbon with the positive charge, and causes the oxygen to get a negative charge, the nucleophile forms a bond with the carbon.
	- The negative charge on the oxygen might react otherwise.
### Hydration
- What happens when you put aldehyde or ketone into water?
	- Lone pair on water attacks as a nucleophile to electrophilic carbon and results in the formation of a thing with 2 alcohols on it
- What do you need for it to form?
	- Strong acid or base


### Acetal and Hemiacetal
- What happens when you add 1 equivalent of alcohol to an aldehyde?
	- The alcohol attacks the electrophilic carbon and is added to it
	- The carbonyl oxygen is reduced to OH and the entire alcohols is substituted onto the electrophilic carbon

- What is that called when you add 1 alcohol to an aldehyde?
	- A hemiketal/acetal. The alcohol is retained, so it's called a "hemi"acetal

- When you add 2 alcohols, what happens?
	- the carbonyl is replaced with the alcohol substituent at both places

- Aldehyde + 1 alcohol => ?
	- Hemiacetal

- Aldehyde + 2 alcohols => ?
	- Acetal

- Ketone + 1 alcohol => ?
	- Hemiketal

- Ketone + 2 alcohol => ?
	- Ketal

- What is the mechanism of hemi and then acetal formation?
	- ![[Pasted image 20250602143053.png]]

- To go from hemi to full, what kind of a reaction is that?
	- Sn1 reaction

- What kidn of environment do ketals/acetals form in?
	- Acidic environment

- Are acetals reactive or nonreactive?
	- Nonreactive

- What are hemiketals/acetals used for?
	- As protecting groups

### Imines and Enamines
- What is an imine?
	- Carbon double bonded to nitrogen with stuff around it

- What is an enamine?
	- Carbon single bonded to nitrogen with double bond to other shit

- What are nitrogen derivatives that reat with aldehydes and ketons?
	- Hydroxylamine
	- Hydrazine
	- Semicarbazide

- What does hydroxylamine form when reacted with a/k?
	- oximes

- What forms when hydrazine reacts with a/k?
	- hydrazones

- what forms when semicarbazide reacts with a/k?
	- semicarbazones


### Cyanohydrins
- What happens when HCN is put with an aldehyde?
	- CN is nucleophilically added across the electrophilic carbon
	- Proton transfer between the nucleophilic O- and the H+, to form somethign with OH and CN

## Redox of A/K
- Can you oxidize a ketone?
	- No.

- Can you oxidize an aldehyde?
	- Yes, into a carboxylic acid

- What are some oxidizing agents to oxidize aldehydes?
	- CrO3, Ag2O, H2O2, KMnO4 

- What happens when you reduce a carboxyl group?
	- you get an alcohol

- What are common reducing agents?
	- LiAlH4
	- NaBH4



# Aldehydes II
- What is an alpha hydrogen?
	- Hydrogen on an alpha carbon, which is a carbon adjacent to double bond

- Why is the alpha hydrogen acidic?
	- Because it is subject to inductive electron withdrawing effects from the carbonyl.

- Are aldehydes or ketones more acidic?
	- Aldehydes are more acidic because the hydrogens are subject to less electron donating


## Keto-Enol Tautomerization
- What is keto-enol tautomeization?
	- Ketones can rapidly interconvert to enol form (alkene + alcohol)

- Is keto/enol a resonance thing?
	- No it's an equilibirum thing

- When can keto/enol tautomerization not happen?
	- If there is no alpha carbon with an acidic hydrogen

- Are ketones or enols preferedd?
	- Ketones are more preferred then enols. 

- Are ketones or enols more stable thermodynamically?
	- Ketones are

- WHat will chiral alpha carbons do?
	- Spontaneously interconvert between keto and enol
- What is a-racemization?
	- Spontaneous interconversion of keto an envol

- How does the enol tautomer form?
	- Deprotonation by a strong base of the alpha hydrogen

- What are common strong bases?
	- KH
	- LDA - Lithium Diisopropyl Amide
	- OH- 
- What is an a,b unsaturated compound?
	- A compound with a mulitple bond between the alpha and beta carbons next to a compound


- What is a Michael addition?
	- Draw it

- Kinetic vs Thermodynamic Enolate
	- Kinetic enolate is faster but unstable
	- Thermodynamic is slower but more stable

- Enamines and Imines
	- Imines are more stable then enamins

- Which is the more stable enol?
	- The one that is more substituted

- What's the diff between an enol and an enolate?
	- Eno
## Aldol Condensaiton
- What is an aldol condensation?
	- Aldehyde / Ketone reacts with Enol to form an aldol (aldehyde with an alcohol on it)
	- alcohol is eliminated to form a double bond and the aldehyde remain

- What happens if you have multiple aldehydes or ketones in your mixture?
	- You cannot control which is the nucelophile and electrophile so you get a mix of products

 - How do you force a single product to form during aldol?
	 - Use a species with no alpha hydrogens

- What kind of reagent do you need for aldol to happen?
	- Strong base


## Retro-Aldol
- What is the retro aldol?
	- The reverse of the aldol

 - What do you need for it to go?
	 - Heat and aqueous base
