F- Electron withdrawing groups increase the acidity of a carboxylic acid
- Electron donating groups decrease the acidity of a carboxylic acid
- B-dicarboxylic acids are things with 2 carboxyl groups that are equidistant from a b-carbon and has a really acidic hydrogne

## Synthesis
- Oxidize an alcohol, ketone, with an oxidizing agent like MnO4 or CrO4


## Reactions
- Nucleophilic acyl substitution
	- Nucleophile attacks the planar carbonyl and forms an tetrahedral intermediate
	- In the presence of H+ ions, proton transfer
	- Elimination of a leaving gorup

- Faovured in both acidic and basic condiitions

- Favoured by a good leaving group
- Naming carboxylic acid derivatives

- Acyl derivative
	- Carboxylic acids
	- Amide
	- Esters
	- Anhydride
### Amide Synth
- Nucleophilic acyl substitution of carboxyl with an ammonia (NH3), or an amine
- In basic or acidic solution

- Naming an amide
	- All alkyl groups are replaced with N-

- Lactam
	- Cyclic amide


### Esters
- What are they?
	- Carboxylic acid but the OH is replaced with OR

- How made?
	- Alcohol reacting with a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions

- What kind of reaction is esterification?
	- Condensation

- What is a condensation reaction?
	- Putting 2 things together and getting water out

- What is a lactone?
	- A cyclic ester

### Anhydride
- What is an anhydride?
	- 2 carbonyl chains connected by an O

	- Take an ether but the 2 side chains are carbonyls


- Formed how?
	- Condensation of 2 carboxylic acids

### Reduction
- How can you reduce a carboxylic acid?
	- Using LiAlH4, not using NaBH4

### Decarboxylation
- What is it?
	- Remove a carboxyl group as a carbon dioxide

- What is the process?
	- A beta-dicarboylic acid undergoes aromatic transiiton to form CO2

- Is decarboxylation spontaneous?
	- Yes, because produces gas

- Where is it used?
	- in the citric acid cycle
### Saponification
- What is saponification?
	- WHen you have a soap 
	- Long chain carboxylic acid in a base


- Property of soaps?
	- Can solvate nonpolar organics in aqueous solutions


- What is a micelle



# Carboxylic Acid Derivatives
## Amides
- How name?
	- Parent chain contains the carbonyl
	- N- for each alkyl sub on the amide, in alphabetical order

- Lactams?
	- 
## Esters
- How name?
	- The parent chain contains the carbonyl. Name it as prefix with -oate

- What is the substituted thing called?
	- The esterifying group

- How formed?
	- Carboxylic acid + alcohol
	- Anhydride + alcohol

- WHatk ind of rx?
	- Condensation

- Higher or lower boiling point then carboxylic acid?
	- Lower

- What is a triacylglycerol?
	- Ester of fatty acid + glycerol

- Saponification?
	- Lysing a fat to to produce soap under a basic hydroxide


- What is fischer esterification?
	- Make an ester by reacting carboxylic acid with an alcohol udner acidic conditions
## Anhydrides
- Which ones can you form by heating?
	- 5,6 membered rings

### Reactivity
- Rnaking by nucleophilic sub reactivity?
	- Anhydride first -> Resonance stabilized electrophile with 3 electrophilic centers
	- Esters 
	- Carboxylic acids
	- Amides


- Sterics
	- When the leaving group is sterically hindered, the nucleophilic attack doesn't go well

- Induction is more or less powerful then conjugation?
	- Less

- Ring strain in a lactam makes it more or less likely to react?
	- MOre



### Reactions
- Anhydride cleavage
	- Ammonia reacts with anhydride to form an amide and water
	- Alcohol + anhydride = ester + water
	- Water + anhydride = carboxylic acid
	- Only useful if symmetric anhydride


- Transesterification
	- Alcohol replaces the esterifying group on an ester wtih it's own alkyl group

- What is the hydrolysis of an amide?
	- Amide turns into carboxylic acid under acidic conditions in water
