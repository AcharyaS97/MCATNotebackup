## Thin Layer Chromatography
- Used for what?
	- Separate nonvoltaile liequids

- What is used to spearate?
	- Things w different polarities

- What is spotting?
	- Putting stuff onto the silica plate

- What is the process of doing Thin Layer chromatography?
	- Put your sample at the bottom, and some solvent in the bottom
	- The solvent moves up the stationary layer by capillary action and the sample gets pulled along for the ride
	- Stuff in the sample that is polar will be around for longer then stuff that's not


- What is the retention factor?
	- Distance travelled by the thing vs distance travelled by the solvent front

- 
- Silica gel is the stationary phase


- Mobile phase is made in a developing chamber
