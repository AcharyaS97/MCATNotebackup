## Infrared Spectroscopy
- What happens when a molecule absorbs an infrared photon.What kinds of things od oyu see?
	- Stretches, Bends

- What is measured in IR spec?
	- The stretches and bends and vibrations when a molecule absorbs IR photon.

- What is the plot of IR spec?
	- 1/ lambda vs transmittance

- What is transmittance?
	- The amount of the light the molecule doesn't absorb

- As transmittance increases, what does that mean?
	- The molecule absorbed less of the light, so was affected less

- As transmittance drops, what does that mean?
	- The wavelength of light corresponds to energy of functional groups in molecules

- What physical change do we need to see for it to affect transmittance on an IR spec?
	- The bond dipole moment has to exist and or change.

- Do we expect IR spec to work on symmetric molecules?
	- No

- Do we expect to see IR spec on molecules without electronegativity difference?
	- No

- As wavenumber increases, does wavelength increase or decrease?
	- Decreases
		- $ v =  \frac{1}{\lambda} $ As v increases, lambda decreases

- What is the infrared range?
	- 750nm (750 * 10^-9) to 1mm

- What is the OH peak?
	- Broad around 3300 cm-1

- What is the NH peak?
	- Sharp around 3300 cm-1

- What is C=O peak?
	- Sharp around 1750 cm-1

- What is relation between absorbance and transmittance?
	- A = 2 - log (% Transmittance)

## UV Spectra
- How does UV spec work?
	- You dissolve the sample in something that can absorb uv light. You pass UV light through the solvent, you measure the amount of absorbance as a function of wavelength

- More conjugated compounds have higher or lower wavelengths of absroption?
	- Max absorption at a lower wavelength

- more conjugated compounds have higher or lower energy transition?
	- Lower energy transition


- If HOMO and LUMO distance is greater for a molecule, are those electrons easier or harder to excite?
	- Harder

- If HUMO - LUMO is small, do you need to absorb higher frequency photon or lower frequency photon?
	- Less energy, lower frequency, higher wavelength

## NMR
- What are alpha state nuclei?
	- Nuclei aligned with the magnetic field

- What are beta state nuclei?
	- Higher energy state

- What is the calibration reference?
	- TetramethylSilane

- What is limitation for what things NMR can work with?
	- odd number of protons or odd number of neutrons

- What is the a-spin state?
	- When nuclei are algined with the magnetic field

- What is the b-spin state?
	- Algied against
	  
- What is the more stable state?
	- a state, because it's less energy to be with grain than against
	  
- What is the resonance in NMR?
	- The fact that nuclei go back and forth between a and beta states
	  
- What do you need to do to convert from a to b?
	- put in energy 
	  
- What is the formula for frequency to go b/w alpha and beta states?
	- $$ \ f = \frac{\gamma}{2\pi} B_{o}$$

- What is the resonant frequency?
	- Frequency to go b/w alpha and beta states

- What is shielding?
	- Amount of electrons around nucleus

 - As number of electrons increases, what happens to shiedling?
	 - INcreases

- What is effect of shielding on energy needed to shift b/w states?
	- As shielding increases, the magnetic field experienced goes down, so frequency goes down

- As shieldoing goes up, resonant frequency is upshifted or downshifted?
	- shieldoing goes up, beff goes down, f goes down ,so it upshits

- how many signals in CH3 CH2 Br?
	- 2

 - how many signals in dimethylether? (CH3OCH3)
	 - 1
	 - each h on each carbon is equivalent?

- how do you determine number of signals?
	- you look at how many "unique" carbon atoms. accounting for hte fact that hydrogens on carbons will rotate.

- What is the reference signal?
	- Tetramethyl silane

- What is $\delta$ in relation to nmr?
	- (frequency / operating frequency)

- does downfield mean increased resonant frequency or decreased?
	- increased
