## Scientific Method
- How do you evaluate the relative value of a research question?
- What are the stages of the scientific method?
	- 1. Generate a testable question
	- 2. Gather data and resources
	- 3. Form a hypothesis
		- If-then statement
	- 4. Collect new data
		- Observation
		- Experimentation
	- 5.Analyze the data
	- 6.Interpret data
	- 7.Publish resutls
	- 8.Verify experiments under new conditions
- What is observation?
	- When get gather data by observing how thigns are in nature 
- WHat is experimentation?
	- Gatehr data by putting specimens into a series of controlled environments
- Quality and testability of a hypothesis?

## Finer Method
- What is the FINER method used to answer?
	- Whether a research question will add to the body of scientific knowledge in a practical way within a reasonable time control.
	  
- FINER Method for evaluating research question 
	- F - Is the question feasible? Eg is it possible for a scientist to get the necessary materials or approvals they need to do the study?
	- I - Do other scientists find the outcome interesting?
	- N - Is the question novel? Has it been asked before?
	- E - Is it ethical to run the study?
	- R - Is it relevant outside the scientific comunity?
## Basic Science Research
- What is Basic Science Research?
	- Kind conducted in a lab and not on people

- What is a control?
	- A control is a group that is a comparison group.

- Waht is positive control?
	- Ensure a change in the dependent variable when it is expected
	- Eg an assay of blood cells, one that you inject with HIV yourself will be the positive control

- What is the negative control?
	- Ensure no change in dependent variable when expected
	- eg administer drug assay to cells that you know don't have HIV

- What is causality?
	- If/Then relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
	- If change in independent variable causes chagne in the dependent variable in the absence of any confounding factors, the relatoinship is causal

- What is accuracy?
	- How close a measurement is to the true value

- What is reliabilty?
	- How close measurements are to each other

- What is systematic error?
	- Error that affects validity and reliability
	  
- Identify common types and sources of error
- Recognize independent and dependent variables and how they are typically displayed graphically
- Explain the importance of the different types of control, including positive and negative controls
- Distinguish between accuracy and precision:
## Human Subject Research
- Apply Hillâ€™s criteria to an experiment to determine the likelihood of a causal relationship
- Distinguish between observational and experimental research
- Compare and contrast bias and confounding
  
- In biomedical research are experimental designs still possible?
	- Yes
- What is randomization used for?
	- Used to control for differences between subject groups in a biomedical research study so that people in groups are assigned at random.
- What is blinding
	- When the experimentor and/or the subject doesn't know what treatment group they are in.
- What is single blinding?
	- Only the assessor and the patient know the treatment group. Investigator doesn't know.
- What is double blinding?
	- Neither the investigator, assessor nor patient know what group the patient is in.

- What does blinding allow you to do?
	- Reduces placebo effect in the control and treatment group.

- What kinds of variables are there?
	- categorical - state of residence, socioeconomic status, 
	- binary - yes/no
	- continuous variables - Heart rate, % improvement in cardiac output

- What kinds of observational studies are there?
	- Cohort studies
		- Studies that follow groups of subjects based on diff things
	- Cross sectional studies
		- Categorize based on groups at a single point in time
	- Case control studies
		- Look at how many people with / without a given outcome. 
## Ethics
- What are the 4 core principles of medical ethics?
	- Beneficience - Act in the best interest of the person 
	- Nonmaleficence - Do not do things that might cause harm
	- Respect for patient autonomy -Respect the ability of someone to dmake their own choices 
	- Justice - Responsiblity to treat similar patients w similar care.

- What are the 3 main things in research ethics from the Belmont Report?
	- Respect for persons
	- Justice
	- Beneficience
	  
- What are the 2 parts of Respect For Persons?
	- Honesty between the subject and researcher
	- Usually but not always prohibits deception
	- Confidentiality 

- What is informed consent?
		- A person is given enough information to be able to make an informed knowledgeable decision about whether or not to participate in a study

- Who is included in vulnerable populations?
		- Pregnant individuals,  prisoners, children

- What is Justice in the context of research ethics?
	- What kinds of research topics to pursue but also how you execute research and pick subjects
	  
- What is a morally relevant difference?
	- A difference between individuals that is considered an appropriate reason to treat them differently. 
	  
- What is an example of a morally relevant difference?
	- Age. A transplant that is likely to benefit a young child vs an adult will be given to the adult all else being equal. 

- What are examples of morally relevant differences?
	- Age, population size

- What are not examples of morally relevant differences?
	- Race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, financial status

- What is Beneficence?
	- Intent to do net good in general and minimize harms
	- Research should be conducted in the least invasive, painful, harmful way possible.

- According to benefience, if you can do a measurement with a cathetar or a finger stick which should you do?
	- Finger stick
	  
- What is equipoise?
	- If you do research and it's clear that one treatment is better than another then you are obligated to stop the research trial and stop providing the inferior trial
	  
 
## Research in the Real World
- Compare and contrast internal and external validity
- Explain the impact of sample size on generalizability
- Recall the qualities a study must have to justify an intervention
- What is population in a research study?
	- A complete group that satisfies the attribute of interest

- What is a parameter?
	- Information that is calculated using every single person in a population

- What is a sample?
	- Any group taken from a population that doesn't include everyone.

- Is a statistic on a sample or on a population?
	- Statistic is calculated on a sample.

- What is internal validity?
	- Does the thing that you're measuring actually do what you think its doing?

- What is external validity?
	- How much can you generalize findings?

- What is generalizability?
	- Very narrow conditions for sample selection

- What are statistically significant resutls?
	- Results that aren ot because of random chance?

- What are clinically significant results?
	- Notable changes in health status due to intervention
